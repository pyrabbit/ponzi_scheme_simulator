    "The topic I chose to demonstrate was to design a recursive algorithm that calculated the number of months a ponzi scheme could function without breaking the bank. A brief explanation of a ponzi scheme is when someone makes promises of a low risk/high reward investment opportunity. Investments are not actually backed by anything but rather paid by future investor's investments. This can only work as long as there is a continuous flow of new investors. Generally, the sooner you fall victim to a ponzi scheme the better off you are. It is the investors at the tail end of a ponzi schemes life that usually lose the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our scenario, our ponzi scheme operator is asking people to invest 1000 dollars promising an 8 percent return each month. However, with every new investor, recruitment grows increasingly difficult taking twice as long to get the next investor as it did the last. Assuming each investor has an initial investment of 1000 dollars and they were each promised an 8 percent return each month. How long would it take for the ponzi scheme to collapse given zero initial investors and zero available funds?"
